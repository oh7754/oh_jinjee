                    anything written in red ink is false and only there to get the truth past the censors. 
                    A month goes by and the man’s friends receive a letter written in blue ink: 
                    “Everything is wonderful here. Stores are full of good food. Movie theaters show good films from the West.
                     Apartments are large and luxurious. The only thing you cannot buy is red ink.”</p>
